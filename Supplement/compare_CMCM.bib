@article{Ray2022,
	abstract = {Genetic association studies of child health outcomes often employ family-based study designs. One of the most popular family-based designs is the case-parent trio design that considers the smallest possible nuclear family consisting of two parents and their affected child. This trio design is particularly advantageous for studying relatively rare disorders because it is less prone to type 1 error inflation due to population stratification compared to population-based study designs (e.g., case-control studies). However, obtaining genetic data from both parents is difficult, from a practical perspective, and many large studies predominantly measure genetic variants in mother-child dyads. While some statistical methods for analyzing parent-child dyad data (most commonly involving mother-child pairs) exist, it is not clear if they provide the same advantage as trio methods in protecting against population stratification, or if a specific dyad design (e.g., case-mother dyads vs. case-mother/control-mother dyads) is more advantageous. In this article, we review existing statistical methods for analyzing genome-wide marker data on dyads and perform extensive simulation experiments to benchmark their type I errors and statistical power under different scenarios. We extend our evaluation to existing methods for analyzing a combination of case-parent trios and dyads together. We apply these methods on genotyped and imputed data from multiethnic mother-child pairs only, case-parent trios only or combinations of both dyads and trios from the Gene, Environment Association Studies consortium (GENEVA), where each family was ascertained through a child affected by nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate. Results from the GENEVA study corroborate the findings from our simulation experiments. Finally, we provide recommendations for using statistical genetic association methods for dyads.},

@article{Gjerdevik2018,
	abstract = {With case-parent triad data, one can frequently deduce parent of origin of the child's alleles. This allows a parent-of-origin (PoO) effect to be estimated as the ratio of relative risks associated with the alleles inherited from the mother and the father, respectively. A possible cause of PoO effects is DNA methylation, leading to genomic imprinting. Because environmental exposures may influence methylation patterns, gene-environment interaction studies should be extended to allow for interactions between PoO effects and environmental exposures (i.e., PoOxE). One should thus search for loci where the environmental exposure modifies the PoO effect. We have developed an extensive framework to analyze PoOxE effects in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), based on complete or incomplete case-parent triads with or without independent control triads. The interaction approach is based on analyzing triads in each exposure stratum using maximum likelihood estimation in a log-linear model. Interactions are then tested applying a Wald-based posttest of parameters across strata. Our framework includes a complete setup for power calculations. We have implemented the models in the R software package Haplin. To illustrate our PoOxE test, we applied the new methodology to top hits from our previous GWAS, assessing whether smoking during the periconceptional period modifies PoO effects on cleft palate only.},

@article{Gjerdevik2020,
	abstract = {Selecting the best design for genetic association studies requires careful deliberation; different study designs can be used to scan for different genetic effects, and each design has its own set of strengths and limitations. A variety of family and unrelated control configurations are amenable to genetic association analyses, including the case-control design, case-parent triads, and case-parent triads in combination with unrelated controls or control-parent triads. Ultimately, the goal is to choose the design that achieves the highest statistical power using the lowest cost. For given parameter values and genotyped individuals, designs can be compared directly by computing the power. However, a more informative and general design comparison can be achieved by studying the relative efficiency, defined as the ratio of variances of two different parameter estimators, corresponding to two separate designs. Using log-linear modeling, we derive the relative efficiency from the asymptotic variance of the parameter estimators and relate it to the concept of Pitman efficiency. The relative efficiency takes into account the fact that different designs impose different costs relative to the number of genotyped individuals. We show that while optimal efficiency for analyses of regular autosomal effects is achieved using the standard case-control design, the case-parent triad design without unrelated controls is efficient when searching for parent-of-origin effects. Due to the potential loss of efficiency, maternal genes should generally not be adjusted for in an initial genome-wide association study scan of offspring genes but instead checked post hoc. The relative efficiency calculations are implemented in our R package Haplin.},
