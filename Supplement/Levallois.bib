	abstract = {The effects of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) on adverse birth outcomes remain unsettled. Maternal genetic variants in relation to DBP metabolism may modify this effect. Pregnant women during late pregnancy (n = 1306) were included from a Chinese cohort. Maternal urinary trichloroacetic acid (TCAA) was measured as a biomarker of DBP exposure. Maternal genotyping was conducted in cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1; rs2031920, rs3813867, and rs915906) and glutathione S-transferase zeta-1 (GSTZ1; rs7975). The associations between maternal urinary TCAA and birth outcomes and statistical interactions between maternal exposure and genetic polymorphisms were estimated. We found that maternal urinary TCAA levels were associated with decreased birth weight (P for trend = 0.003) and ponderal index (P for trend = 0.004). Interaction analyses showed that maternal urinary TCAA in association with decreased birth weight was observed only among subjects with CYP2E1 rs3813867 GC/CC versus GG (Pint = 0.07) and associations with decreased birth length, ponderal index, and gestational age were observed only among subjects with GSTZ1 rs7975 GA/AA versus GG (Pint = 0.07, 0.02, and 0.02, respectively). Our results suggested that prenatal DBP exposure was negatively associated with birth weight and ponderal index, and maternal genetic polymorphisms in CYP2E1 and GSTZ1 might modify these associations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We examined the association between exposure during pregnancy to trihalomethanes, the most common water disinfection by-products, and birth outcomes in a European cohort study (Health Impacts of Long-Term Exposure to Disinfection By-Products in Drinking Water). We took into account exposure through different water uses, measures of water toxicity, and genetic susceptibility.
METHODS: We enrolled 14,005 mothers (2002-2010) and their children from France, Greece, Lithuania, Spain, and the UK. Information on lifestyle- and water-related activities was recorded. We ascertained residential concentrations of trihalomethanes through regulatory records and ad hoc sampling campaigns and estimated route-specific trihalomethane uptake by trimester and for whole pregnancy. We examined single nucleotide polymorphisms and copy number variants in disinfection by-product metabolizing genes in nested case-control studies.
RESULTS: Average levels of trihalomethanes ranged from around 10 μg/L to above the regulatory limits in the EU of 100 μg/L between centers. There was no association between birth weight and total trihalomethane exposure during pregnancy (β = 2.2 g in birth weight per 10 μg/L of trihalomethane, 95% confidence interval = 3.3, 7.6). Birth weight was not associated with exposure through different routes or with specific trihalomethane species. Exposure to trihalomethanes was not associated with low birth weight (odds ratio [OR] per 10 μg/L = 1.02, 95% confidence interval = 0.95, 1.10), small-for-gestational age (OR = 0.99, 0.94, 1.03) and preterm births (OR = 0.98, 0.9, 1.05). We found no gene-environment interactions for mother or child polymorphisms in relation to preterm birth or small-for-gestational age.
CONCLUSIONS: In this large European study, we found no association between birth outcomes and trihalomethane exposures during pregnancy in the total population or in potentially genetically susceptible subgroups. (See video abstract at http://links.lww.com/EDE/B104.).},

@article{Riederer2014,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Trihalomethanes (THMs) are water disinfection by-products that have been associated with bladder cancer and adverse birth outcomes. Four THMs (bromoform, chloroform, bromodichloromethane, dibromochloromethane) were measured in blood and tap water of U.S. adults in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2006. THMs are metabolized to potentially toxic/mutagenic intermediates by cytochrome p450 (CYP) 2D6 and CYP2E1 enzymes.
OBJECTIVES: We conducted exploratory analyses of blood THMs, including factors affecting CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 activity.
METHODS: We used weighted multivariable regressions to evaluate associations between blood THMs and water concentrations, survey year, and other factors potentially affecting THM exposure or metabolism (e.g., prescription medications, cruciferous vegetables, diabetes, fasting, pregnancy, swimming).
RESULTS: From 1999 to 2006, geometric mean blood and water THM levels dropped in parallel, with decreases of 32%-76% in blood and 38%-52% in water, likely resulting, in part, from the lowering of the total THM drinking water standard in 2002-2004. The strongest predictors of blood THM levels were survey year and water concentration (n = 4,232 total THM; n = 4,080 bromoform; n = 4,582 chloroform; n = 4,374 bromodichloromethane; n = 4,464 dibromochloromethane). We detected statistically significant inverse associations with diabetes and eating cruciferous vegetables in all but the bromoform model. Medications did not consistently predict blood levels. Afternoon/evening blood samples had lower THM concentrations than morning samples. In a subsample (n = 230), air chloroform better predicted blood chloroform than water chloroform, suggesting showering/bathing was a more important source than drinking.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified several factors associated with blood THMs that may affect their metabolism. The potential health implications require further study.},

@article{Gemma2003,
	abstract = {The oxidative and reductive cytochrome P450 (P450)-mediated chloroform bioactivation has been investigated in human liver microsomes (HLM), and the role of human P450s have been defined by integrating results from several experimental approaches: cDNA-expressed P450s, selective chemical inhibitors and specific antibodies, correlation studies in a panel of phenotyped HLM. HLM bioactivated CHCl(3) both oxidatively and reductively. Oxidative reaction was characterized by two components, suggesting multiple P450 involvement. The high affinity process was catalyzed by CYP2E1, as clearly indicated by kinetic studies, correlation with chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylation (r = 0.837; p < 0.001), and inhibition by monoclonal antihuman CYP2E1 and 4-methylpyrazole. The low affinity phase of oxidative metabolism was essentially catalyzed by CYP2A6. This conclusion was supported by the correlation with coumarin 7-hydroxylase (r = 0.777; p < 0.01), inhibition by coumarin and by the specific antibody, in addition to results with heterologously expressed P450s. Chloroform oxidation was poorly dependent on pO(2), whereas the reductive metabolism was highly inhibited by O(2). The production of dichloromethyl radical was significant only at CHCl(3) concentration > or =1 mM, increasing linearly with substrate concentration. CYP2E1 was the primary enzyme involved in the reductive reaction, as univocally indicated by all the different approaches. The reductive pathway seems to be scarcely relevant in the human liver, since it is active only at high substrate concentrations, and in strictly anaerobic conditions. The role of human CYP2E1 in CHCl(3) metabolism at low levels, typical of actual human exposure, provides insight into the molecular basis for eventual difference in susceptibility to chloroform-induced effects due to either genetic, pathophysiological, or environmental factors.},

@article{Meek2002,
	abstract = {Chloroform has been assessed as a Priority Substance under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. The general population in Canada is exposed to chloroform principally through inhalation of indoor air, particularly during showering, and through ingestion of tap water. Data on concentrations of chloroform in various media were sufficient to serve as the basis for development of deterministic and probabilistic estimates of exposure for the general population in Canada. On the basis of data acquired principally in studies in experimental animals, chloroform causes hepatic and renal tumors in mice and renal tumors in rats. The weight of evidence indicates that chloroform is likely carcinogenic only at concentrations that induce the obligatory precursor lesions of cytotoxicity and proliferative regenerative response. Since this cytotoxicity is primarily related to rates of formation of reactive, oxidative metabolites, dose response has been characterized in the context of rates of formation of reactive metabolites in the target tissue. Results presented here are from a "hybrid" physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) animal model that was revised to permit its extension to humans. The relevant measure of exposure response, namely, the mean rate of metabolism in humans associated with a 5% increase in tumor risk (TC05), was estimated on the basis of this PBPK model and compared with tissue dose measures resulting from 24-h multimedia exposure scenarios for Canadians based on midpoint and 95th percentiles for concentrations in outdoor air, indoor air, air in the shower compartment, air in the bathroom after showering, tap water, and food. Nonneoplastic effects observed most consistently at lowest concentrations or doses following repeated exposures of rats and mice to chloroform are cytotoxicity and regenerative proliferation. As for cancer, target organs are the liver and kidney. In addition, chloroform has induced nasal lesions in rats and mice exposed by both inhalation and ingestion at lowest concentrations or doses. The mean rate of metabolism associated with a 5% increase in fatty cysts estimated on the basis of the PBPK model was compared with tissue dose measures resulting from the scenarios already described, and lowest concentrations reported to induce cellular proliferation in the nasal cavities of rats and mice were compared directly with midpoint and 95th percentile estimates of concentrations of chloroform in indoor air in Canada. The degree of confidence in the underlying database and uncertainties in estimates of exposure and in characterization of hazard and dose response are delineated.},

@article{levallois2016,
	abstract = {Background
Exposure to disinfection by-products (DBPs) during pregnancy was associated with reduced foetal growth. Genetic susceptibility might play a role, especially for genes encoding for the Cytochrome P450 (CYP2E1) and Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) enzymes, involved in metabolism and activation of DBPs. Few epidemiological studies evaluated these gene-environment interactions and their results were never replicated.
Objective
This study aims to examine interactions between trihalomethanes (THM) or haloacetic acids (HAA) exposure and genetic polymorphisms on small for gestational age (SGA) neonates by investigating single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CYP2E1 gene and GSTM1 and GSTT1 deletions in mothers-children pairs.
Methods
A population-based case-control study of 1549 mothers and 1455 children was conducted on SGA and THM/HAA exposure. DNA was extracted from blood or saliva cells. Targeted SNPs and deletions were genotyped. Statistical interaction between SNPs/deletions and THMs or HAAs in utero exposure with regard to SGA occurrence was evaluated by unconditional logistic regression with control of potential confounders.
Results
Previously reported positive modification of the effect of THM uterine exposure by mothers or newborns CYP2E1 rs3813867 C allele or GSTM1 deletion was not replicated. However interactions with CYP2E1 rs117618383 and rs2515641 were observed but were not statistically significant after correction for multiple testing.
Conclusions
Previous positive interactions between THMs exposure and CYP2E1 and GSTM1 were not replicated but interactions with other CYP2E1 polymorphisms are reported.},
